## Why Blockchain?
I feel like that's the first question that always has to be asked at the start of any project. Whether it's a personal project or professional, there's always one task master that must be heard:
Time. That usually translates to money in professional projects, but the question is always the same: Why is this worth my/our time? If you've somehow stumbled on this and have decided to read it,
I'm assuming you know - at least implicitly - your own answers to this question, but I want to go through mine.

##### Just cool
For me this is still a new bit of technology, and I love new toys.
##### Interesting
I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn. I love learning languages and frameworks, and this is a chance for me to learn a whole new technology, and I can't pass that up.
##### Potential
This is really the most important, and how I have justified the project to my inner tech lead. Having only a high-level understanding of the technology and  without understanding the limitations of 
the technology, I have a few ideas for potential applications. As I learn more, I wholeheartedly expect for some of those ideas to drop off as less important or too complicated, but I'm starting with 
bright, hopeful eyes.

## Toolset
When starting a new project a (at least initial) toolset needs to be defined. I've decided that I want tho use this project to learn a little more about .NET Core, so that's what I've gone with.
I've used C# on a few projects, but this will be my first deep dive into the new platform.

## So Far
I've decided to follow [this](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/blockchain-basics-building-a-blockchain-in-net-core/) tutorial in order to build a chain from scratch. So far I have built the 
first post and set up a few tests. The blog post doesn't really go through how to test, so I've set up test following the instructions in the GitHub docs found 
[here](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/docs/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test.md). 

So far I haven't struggled with too much, though at present all I have is a super simple console app that creates a chain and adds a few to it. The repo for it right now is private, but once I have 
a working model, I intend to put it out in the wild.
