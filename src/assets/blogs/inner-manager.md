# My Inner Bureaucrat
I have a lot of ideas. I mean, a ton of ideas. I have more ideas in my head than I could possibly ever have time to complete, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that. Any of those ideas could be huge 
(OK, if I'm being honest, maybe not _any_). Because of this awe-inspiring plethora of wonderful ideas running around my head like gazelles in an African savannah I have a problem. What do I work on?
I'll admit too many ideas isn't a bad problem to have, but it is a problem. Any one of them would be exciting to work on, made the more so because they are my ideas. There are so many hours in a day,
so I can only work on so much at a time. 

I could actually start all of them, and work on each little by little, but as any Kanaban adherent will tell you, the quickest way to deliver value is limiting work in progress. This is especially 
true for a one man army. That being said, I actually have two buffers open in vim as I write this... To answer this I've started calling on my inner bureaucrat. In cartoons you could often see a 
little angel and a devil on a character's shoulders; well, for me on one side I have a bureaucrat and the other a slacker. To be honest, the slacker is definitely the driver far more often, but
I've started seeing a very real need for the bureaucrat. He keeps me organized...sort of...and has helped me understand I can't do everything all at once, so he's the one that's directing my focus
and the one who tries to listen to my justifications for what project I want to work on when, and ultimately the one that tells when I've totally missed the mark on an idea to bring me back on track.

Side note, this post absolutely had his approval.
